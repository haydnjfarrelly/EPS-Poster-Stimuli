# EPS-Poster-Stimuli
Examples of the stimuli used for a research project forming part of my PhD. This repository gives access to these stimuli when scanning a QR code on my poster presented at the Experimental Psychology Society Lancaster 2025 meeting.

# Traditional Pattern Glare Stimuli
These are the original static Pattern Glare stimuli which are used in the computerised Pattern Glare Test (Braithwaite et al., 2013).

# Flickered Pattern Glare Stimuli
The first experimental manipulation for this study. These are examples of the flickered Pattern Glare stimuli. Here I have used the irritating (medium frequency) grating only, this is for display purposes. Participants were exposed to both the irritating (medium frequency) and non-irritating (high frequency) gratings at all rates of flicker.

#  Multisensory Flickered Pattern Glare Stimuli
The second experimental manipulation for this study. These are examples of the flickered Pattern Glare stimuli paired with auditory tones frequency-modulated at a matched rate to the visual flicker. Again, only the irritating (medium frequency) gratin is presented here, this is for display purposes only.
