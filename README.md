# Traditional Pattern Glare Stimuli
All stimuli below are square wave gratings used in the computerised Pattern Glare Test (Braithwaite et al., 2013a). Note that the exact spatial frequencies here will vary from those used experimentally, as spatial frequency is dependent on situational factors such as viewing distance, stimulus size, and visual angle.

Much of the information below was initially derived from a series of behavioural and neuroimaging investigations which followed the creation of a paper-based Pattern Glare test in the 1980's (Wilkins et al., 1984), culminating in a consensus paper on the 'normative' effects of square wave gratings at various spatial frequencies on visual perception (Evans & Stevenson, 2008). The computerised version of the Pattern Glare Test has comparative normative values as determined by various behavioural (Braithwaite et al., 2013a; Braithwaite et al., 2013b; Fong et al., 2019), neuroimaging (Fong et al., 2020; Fong et al., 2022; Jurkovičová et al., 2024), and brain stimulation (Braithwaite et al., 2015) investigations. 

# Low Frequency Grating (Control)
This is the control stimulus designed to produce no (or at least very few) AVDs. The spatial frequency for this grating is 0.5 cycles-per-degree.

# Medium Frequency Grating (Irritating)
This is the irritating stimulus designed to produce the most AVDs in those who exhibit signs of cortical hyperexcitability. The spatial frequency for this grating is 3 cycles-per-degree.

# High Frequency Grating (Non-irritating)
This is the non-irritating stimulus designed to produce some AVDs, but crucially these are less cortically mediated and arise more through optical processes. The spatial frequency for this grating is 14 cycles-per-degree.
