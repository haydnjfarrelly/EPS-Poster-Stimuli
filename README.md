# EPS-Poster-Stimuli
Examples of the stimuli used for a research project forming part of my PhD. This repository gives access to these stimuli when scanning a QR code on my poster presented at the Experimental Psychology Society Lancaster 2025 meeting.

# Branches
In this repository there are three branches - each contains a different set of stimuli and a READ.ME file with additional information if you would like to know more about them.

# Branch 1 - Traditional Pattern Glare Stimuli
These are the static Pattern Glare stimuli which are traditionally used in the computerised Pattern Glare Test (Braithwaite et al., 2013).
